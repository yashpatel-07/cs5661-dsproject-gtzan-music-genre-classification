# ðŸ“Š GTZAN Dataset - Music Genre Classification

## Project Description

> Around 125 days worth of songs is uploaded to Spotify every 24 hours. This amount of data makes human classification almost impossible, and highly subjective, which necessitates an automated solution. Our AI solution is based on the GTZAN dataset which is a dataset containing 100 songs of 10 different genres, but can be extended as required. We will use a NN model, along with clustering algorithms to create our classifier. Our main goal is to automatically classify music for streaming services (although they likely have their own already), and private individuals' music collections, helping organize their music by genre.
